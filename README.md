# Binary-Neural-Networks
Implemented here a Binary Neural Network (BNN) achieving nearly state-of-art results but recorded a significant reduction in memory usage and total time taken during training the network.

Through this project, we attempt to train Binary Neural Networks(BNNs) which are essentially Neural Networks with binary weights and activations i.e. +1 and -1. BNNs boost the performance in terms of memory usage and computation complexity during the forward propagation. This is achieved by replacing most arithmetic operations with bitwise boolean operations. We compare the performance of a traditional non- binary network with a network designed using two binariza- tion functions: Deterministic and Stochastic. We also compare the train times, performance, memory usage, and speed for the binary and non-binary versions on the fashion-MNIST dataset. We achieve significant improvements with binarized neural networks.
